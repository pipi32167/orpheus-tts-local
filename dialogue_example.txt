leo: hello, Leo speaking, how may I help you?

dan: Hey, Leo. Dan here.

leo: Hey, Dan, how are you?

dan: I've been feeling unwell lately.

leo: Oh, I’m sorry to hear that. What’s wrong?

dan: I had a headache last night. And I have a sore throat and a runny nose this morning. I think I am coming down with the flu.

leo: That sounds terrible. So, you’re calling in sick? Do you need to take the day off, or would you prefer to work from home if you’re able?

dan: I feel slightly feverish. I think I need to take the day off.

leo: That’s completely understandable. Get some rest and take care of yourself.

dan: Thank you, Leo. I really appreciate it.
